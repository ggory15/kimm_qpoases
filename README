!!! ATTENTION
    This repository contains an unofficial and outdated fork of qpOASES. The
    fork is not supported anymore. It may contain bugs that are already fixed 
    in the solver. Please consider obtaining the latest official release from
    http://www.qpOASES.org/ instead of using this code.

Notes:
    - If cputime limit is reached the return value is RET_MAX_NWSR_REACHED.
    - qpOASES may use one of two strategies to deal with semi-definite QP, 
        the default one requires all lower/upper bounds on the decision 
        variables to be active on the first iteration. This is bad for many 
        problems. setToMPC() switches to another strategy (regularization).
